            <h2>3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
            <p><em>In Short: We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a
                    valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to
                    comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations,
                    to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.</em></p>
            <p><strong>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</strong></p>
            <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we
                rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases
                to process your personal information:</p>
            <p><strong>Consent.</strong> We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent)
                to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time.
                Learn more about <a href="#">withdrawing your consent</a>.</p>
            <p><strong>Performance of a Contract.</strong> We may process your personal information when we believe it
                is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations to you, including providing our Services or at your
                request prior to entering into a contract with you.</p>
            <p><strong>Legitimate Interests.</strong> We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably
                necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your
                interests and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal information for
                some of the purposes described in order to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Develop and display personalized and relevant advertising content for our users</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Legal Obligations.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for
                compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory
                agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in
                which we are involved.</p>
            <p><strong>Vital Interests.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to
                protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving
                potential threats to the safety of any person.</p>
            <p><strong>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</strong></p>
            <p>We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use
                your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred
                (i.e., implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time.</p>
            <p>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information
                without your consent, including, for example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a
                    timely way</li>
                <li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>
                <li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>
                <li>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or
                    settle an insurance claim</li>
                <li>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin</li>
                <li>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial
                    abuse</li>
                <li>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or
                    the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to
                    investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</li>
                <li>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of court
                    relating to the production of records</li>
                <li>If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and
                    the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced</li>
                <li>If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes</li>
                <li>If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations</li>

                    credit your account with the relevant reward.</li>
